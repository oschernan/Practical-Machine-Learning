    "Our management team is considering using a language model to classify written customer reviews, call and complaint logs. If certain customer messages are very critical, management would want a customer support personnel to contact the customer who sent the message. This report will outline the work that went into building several classification models while using a 2x2 completely crossed experimental design. Specifically, we will be training/testing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using TensorFlow. Our goal is build multiple RNNs that can classify the sentiment of movie reviews which will allow us to provide the management team some takeaways and answer their questions regarding the usefulness of language models. We will be utilizing pretrained word vectors and data from movie reviews (negative/positive) to develop our RNNs. We will be looking to see the impact that using word vectors with different dimensions and vocabulary sizes has on the accuracy of the RNNs.   "

    "* Define the vocabulary size for the model \n",
    "* Define text preprocessing functions (e.g. add stopwords) \n",
    "* Gather negative/positive movie review text and convert into NumPy array used for embedding (list of 1000 lists with 40 words in each list)\n",
    "* Create y labels and do train/test data split\n",
    "* Create 4 RNNs with the exact same hyperparameters (only difference is the pretrained word vector and vocabulary size of each vector that was used as part of the model development process)\n",

    "* In terms of training each RNN, the computational time was relatively fast compared to CNNs. Although no CNNs were trained in this exercise, this is just a simple reflection from a prior exercise. It may have to do with the type of data that was used. \n",
    "* The pretrained word vectors with 50 dimensions performed better on training accuracy but not on test accuracy compared to the pretrained word vectors with 100 dimensions. \n",
    "* With regards to the impact of vocabulary size, it there was no difference in the training accuracy using vectors with 50 dimensions. There was a minimal decrease in training accuracy when increasing the vocabulary size within the 100 dimension vectors. \n",
    "* It would seem that increasing the dimension size lead to lower training accuracy but better test accuracy. \n",
    "* The difference in test accuracy and training accuracy was more pronounced (difference of 0.15) using the vectors with 50 dimensions compared to the vectors with 100 dimensions (difference of 0.09). \n",
    "* Overall, test accuracy was lower compared to training accuracy across every RNN which may signal potential underfitting. "

    "We would advice management to consider using RNNs as ways to classify customer messaging sentiment. The simple RNNs developed here showed promise when referring to their test accuracy. This accuracy can certainly be improved by perhaps using a different pretrained word vector with higher dimension and higher vocabulary size. Also, there was no hyperparameter optimization that was completed during this exercise which can only serve to improve accuracy. \n",

    "In terms of methods that are relevant to the customer services function, we would want a model that can accurately predict when a customer is upset based on the combination/type of words used in their message. A binary response variable can be used at the output layer which would tell management that a customer is upset. More sophisticated models would perhaps output the degree to which a customer is upset. If we can accurately predict if a customer is upset, we would reduce costs by not reaching out to non-upset customers as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve this accurate prediction, the word vector used to train the model would need to be changed. It would be ideal to have a pretrained word vector that relates to customer satisfaction related to the company's product or industry. For example, using word vector that was pulled from Twitter may not be appropriate to train a model that is expected to predict upset bank customers. Data scientists could develop proprietary word vectors that are more recent and contain updated words that belong to certain classifications (perhaps certain phrases have changed meaning over the years). This can be done through web scraping new sources and/or going through the arduous task of classifying a long list of words by hand. "
